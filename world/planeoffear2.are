The skies overhead twist and swirl in strange shades of indigo and

be a strange scurrying motion across the desolate wastes, but whatever
creature could survive here is beyond any reasonable guess.

The sun beats down heavily upon the land, never yielding its intense heat

across its slippery surface. Thoughts of death can easily creep into one's
mind if the conditions are bad, in this case they are far past that.

Name A Patch of Grass~
Descr
A gently meadow rises up from between the almost pathetic shelter of the
surrounding foothills. Some life actually exists in this bleak landscape
despite the harsh sun. If there was any civilized life in this region then
it only makes sense for it to habit this area, however despite the most
thorough search nothing can be found.

The sun beats down heavily upon the land, never yielding its intense heat
