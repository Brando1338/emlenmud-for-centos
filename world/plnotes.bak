To the builders, I'm sorry but there were problem's which the server
wouldn't come back up. I had to wipe and reload all the areas, causing in
file loss. Since you all have IMM status's, heres what I want you to do.
Type Aedit Create, then from there set yourself a filename, type file
newarea1.are for example. Then type name Joe Smoe's Area, then heres the
tricky part. Type area, see which vnum's are open, do not go above 100,000
or it will mess up, use as little vnums as possible to get your area done.
You must set higher and lower vnums, for example: vnum 97501 to 97550, make
sure you get the numbers right and you dont mess with anyone else's area.
Upon this file loss, I did save Rukzilla's area, it was taking I think a
total of 5000 rooms, which is a little bit silly, so I'll trim it down to
what he needs and re-enter it in when I z_relocate it. Anyways, sorry for
the loss, everything should be fixed now. 
 
Over and out

heya bern,

I added 2 more guards, made a nocast room of the guardroom.

Also put in 2 hidden doors, and a hidden portal somewhere

Ask elburro where it is, and what the portalname is, he should know it.

So we are almost done... I also made the statue of bumblebee and the room description, the statue description is up to you, and feel free to change the room desc if you want to.

Uhm... plz doublecheck everything for me?

I will be back in 17 days, when I get home from vacation.

Take it easy,

Azzie

I edited alteric somewhat by making mobs slightly easier, by removing

annihilate/balefire etc, the mobs are still high level and not soloable

because they all regenerate maybe this would also stimulate use
