The sylvan believe in exercise of the mind as well as the body. Sergeants
can easily outfight their elite soldiers, however they are also able to out
think them. Hours are spent studying old battles and new troop manuevers,
unfortunately because of lamer darkie tactics they are often forced to use
gorilla tactics to defeat the enemy.

Name Before A Secure Gate~
Descr
A large opening has been left between the doors entering and leaving the
outpost. These are undoubtedly intended to trap newer soldiers for an easy
kill by evil darkie hordes. To the north lies a solid looking door. It
appears as if it could take a battering ram and not fall over, or perhaps it
is only strong enough to deter a newbie Sidhai from knocking it over.
