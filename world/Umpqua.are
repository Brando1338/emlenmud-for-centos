Descr
You have stumbled on a strange and small shrine on the southern section
of the lake of mists. Legend has that this spot is where Morlial was
defeated after his revolt of old. The story that you have heard
circulated from time innumerable rumors that Maelodor and Morlial had a
fierce battle and Maelodor fried Morlial to a crisp with a mighty
fireball. This spot was thencefore marked in memorial of the great day.

Name Lake of the Mists~

The lake of the Mists is aptly named -- it is covered in a dense,
forboding, humid fog. The eerie mist covers everything, making it difficult
to see where you are going. To complicate matters further, the huge
mosquitoes keep trying to carry you off. They flock around you looking for a
quick meal.

You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

Name Umpqua Bog~
Descr
You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

Name Umpqua Bog~
Descr
You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

Descr
The lake you are travelling on seems to be the origin of the thick mists  that cover the forest to the east. The Lake of Mists is said to be home of  all sorts of strange and wondrous creatures. The only thing that seems  apparant for now is the size of the mosquitos. The bird sized creatures  flock around you looking for a quick meal.   ~

You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

In the middle of this small clearing in the forest is a small temple. A
blood-stained altar seems to be the focal-point. It appears something was
sacrificed here not too long in the past. Blood stains the altar and various
bones are scattered around. The stench of death is high.

The lake of the Mists is aptly named -- it is covered in a dense,
forboding, humid fog. The eerie mist covers everything, making it difficult
to see where you are going. To complicate matters further, the huge
mosquitoes keep trying to carry you off. They flock around you looking for a
quick meal.

Name Lake of the Mists~
Descr
The Lake of the Mists is aptly named -- it is covered in a dense,
forboding, humid fog. The eerie mist covers everything, making it
difficult to see where you are going. To complicate matters further, the
huge mosquitoes keep trying to carry you off. They flock around you
looking for a quick meal.

Name A Small Grove Next to River Caldir~
Descr
In this small grove near the peaceful River Caldir near the Lake of the
Mists stands a small obelisk seemingly at the head of the grove
formation. It is said that this is the spot that the ancient druids
observe their solstice celebrations. Whether this is true or not is
unknown, however, druids encircle the area apparently learning the druidic
teachings as they have for eons. A sense of peace and the tinge of magic
wash over you as you bask in the peacefulness of the place.

Travel on the ancient Caldir river is easy and smooth. The slow waters

Druids of old used to use this river to travel to the groves of Maol-Mhuire
for their solstice offerings to the Gods, however you have seen no sign of
the Druid cities. Could this be a myth?

Name A Marshy Bog Near Umpqua Forest~
Descr
You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

Name Umpqua Bog~
Descr
You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

Name Umpqua Bog~
Descr
You are traversing a marshy bog to the west of Umpqua Forest. The marshy
earth sucks at your boots and travel is difficult. The thick mist that
permiates the air of the forest seems to originate somewhere west of here,
hence the air here is even thicker with humidity. There is, however, one
difference. Mosquitoes the size of small birds seem to call this area home.
They congregate with deftness on any warm blooded animal that passes the
area. You are staked as lunch.

You are travelling a small hidden path eastward from the forest. The air
here is less thick with mist but you still sense a great forboding. It's

for their solstice offerings to the Gods, however you have seen no sign of
the Druid cities. Could this be a myth?
