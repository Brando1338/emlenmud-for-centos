You have found where the priest Halon lives in exile. Once the spiritual

This is the Northwest Pass, a cold snow blown road that has seen better
times. This road is in much better repair than the trail to the south of
Athenae. It would seem the people that use it survived the great war in much
better shape than their southern counterparts.

Though very near the Northwest Pass this part of the woods is too thick

sharp contrast to the evil you sense to the northwest.
