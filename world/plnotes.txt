No it is not ok just to hit save.
If there is a crash and you lose eq. It is gone then. If you do not keep a screen shot of your eq
inventory or storage. If it is lost then we can no longer do anything about it.
 
So type world so we have an accurate date, eq hit print screen open up imaging
paste into imaging and then save it where you cand find it easy. This helps you.
 
This was an idea that IF a crash happens and your pfile was not saved, you can get anything you
lost back insted of us going we dont know.
 
It was an idea, if you do not want to do it then I guess that is your choice.
I however would keep a good copy of my eq, inventory, and storage.

There will be no reimbursements without a screenshot unless it is

provide me with a screenshot, you will get nothing.  If you do not know
how to make a screen shot please see help screen shot for directions.
 
This is not to insult anyone or call them liars but it is for our

a text log file.  
 
If you have any concerns about this, please consult me directly.
 
I would recommend making a screenshot every once in a while to keep
as a backup incase something major happens and your window gets
closed on you or something.  Another way is to log out and log
back in once in a while or by typing save a couple times.

Subject !melee kick flurry bug~
Text
I have taken the plague of emlen !melee bug out of the game.
It was a very easy fix none the less and do not know why no one ever fixed it before.
 
All that was happening is you have different positions:
bashed, casting, standing, fighting, mining, ect ect.
well when you would stop casting you would be sent into POSITION_STANDING
When that happened it would allow you to kick into melee right when you hit the command kick
 
then in do_kick and do_flurry there was no check for it because you were in a standing position
Now there are checks in do_kick, do_flurry, and do_tackle
 
You will no longer be able to kick, tackle, or flurry if you have been in a cast.
so this means if you see:
 
You begin to utter some strange incantations...
and you type kick
 
you will now see:
 
You stop casting.
You can not try to kick someone after trying to cast! You would fall on your ass!!!
 
Enjoy and Samson I will get to you about pointing this out to me once I see you online and now that it is fixed.

Subject Humans~
Text
For all those Humans out there, anyone that rolled a Human before today
will be allowed to ascend when they meet the qualifications that the rest of
the people need to meet. You will need to contact an immortal to do this.
The disadvantage of doing so is your stats will not be 25 across. If your
original stats were higher than the race you are changing then they will
have to be changed. You will be allowed a roll of 90 for when you ascend and
the rest of the allowances/rules apply. If you would like to move your
stats, the cost is still 25 warpoints per stat. Also, by changing to not 25
across you won't be able to change to all the different classes in the game.
You make your choice what you want to do and let me know. 
The only reason I am allowing this is because at the beginning of the
wipe people didn't think it would be worth it to evolve and then ascend.
Since evolve was taken out, now more people believe it is worth it to
ascend and it is a semi-major change I will make an allowance for this.

6 seconds to cast, does 100 damage and blinds. Clerics do not have a utility
spell (something that does 100 in a bash). The blind is no big deal, takes
no mana and .5round to cure. I'd rather cast blind twice (more likely to
stick) and acid arrow twice (same damage, divided in half in case of an
early flee). Those 4 spells taking the same time as searing to cast. That's

Ok once again this is for bs damage and circle damage. They were complaining they

can't hole punch so did a little mixing in the code.

 

I lowered the attack damage messages to match the damage done.

 

I also added hand augs to the end of the bs and circle formulas, Yes they were in the formula in the first place

but they were in a crappy place. In the middle heh :p

 So by putting them in at the end will make them worth while I hope.

 

We will try this and if you like it we keep it. If you do not like well tough luck :p

This is just a heads up about the change. I will post a date for sure

when this will be happening and the mud will be down during that time so we

can get all the current playerfiles and copy them over to the new server.

Hopefully once we are moved the game won't lag as much as it does. I just

I would like to take a look at "fixing" some of the spells 

in the game.  For instance the following two spells have formulas

that don't work correctly or fit the profession who can gain the

spells.

 

Dispel Undead - forumal c*g+c+cz80m110

why should a cleric spell check for wizards guild? 

plus the max obtainable damage in the formula is less than the min.

 

Turn Undead - formula c*g+c+cz90m120

again checks for wizards instead of necros.  does a max of 60 

damage far below the min. 

 

I've seen many other spells which formulas that don't make

much sense either.  I would like to try to fix up the non-pk ones

and then work with you guys to fix any pk type spells. 

 

Let me know.

Text
Ok been told that Dark Mist is UBER powerful :)

 

With Wound Confuse Plague Lethargy Mindsap for affects

this means Mist is almost insta death.

 

So talking with a cleric... we came up with this idea.

 

Set duration to 1 tick and leave all affects,

Or set duration to 2 ticks and remove mindsap.

 

The area part of the spell is gone however.

Reason: There are no saves to this spell. You can not resist these

affects and if you do you are very lucky.

 

Spell hits you and you get all affects... you save the spell you

get none of the affects but they way it is now... you get hit you

got the spell on you.

 

But we also want to know what you think we should do.

3 of the affects will stay. You all pick and choose make up your

spells about this and post them. right now darkmist will be 1 tick

no area and all affects.

 

You decide what the affects shold turn out to be.

 

Pick 3 of the 5 and we will post ideas and stats on them.

As I said atm it is at 1 tick.. all affects.. no area.

 

If you do not want it changed we will make a cure spell for it.

Call cure mist. or some shit :p

1st, I am a little disapointed with your "we talked to a cleric". You

talked only to someone on the side that was receiving the spell, because

Duncan does not count as a cleric (with 20 hours of playtime and never

casing mist/essence, or any other big spell). I know of no dark casting the

spell, ever. You kinda dissed me, as I am the oly cleric with more than

200hours playtime. Anyway, the 3 critical affects are mindsap, leth, and

wounding. It lasting 1 tick means that it lasts only whatever is left of a

tick when the person flees. Thus, if they flee and it ticks 5 seconds later,

the spell was worthless. Also, the spell is resisted just as much as any

other as far as i can see, having cast the spell on darks many times. I

don't want you to think that I am trying to get powerful. I intend to mort

and go mage, so do not take my comments as either complaints or trying to

get cheater power. The only offensive spell that clerics had was made not

area, that kinda bites considering that mages cast hurricane which is - a ton

of str and dex (it's like leth cause impact of IN PAIN heavy. Also,

hurricane does a ton of damage and blinds. Obviously, if i want a cleric

spell, hurricane is the best option. Not to mention balefire, summon,

teleport, etc. Healing is just not worth it. I guess im selfish, but I do

not find cleric to compare to the fun/power/wps of other classes.

I vote no to detect chameleon. Thieves rely solely on their backstabbing
ability and mainly suck in combat except for Critical hit. Taking away their
ability to get off a free backstab would be to reduce their usefuless. I
would like to however state my approval of reducing the numbers of double
backstabs that are being achieved. A potential 1,000 hp loss is very
daunting. In my mind backstab should do damage similar to an atomize for a
mage.

Ok I have decided Detect-Cham will be put in by all the votes.
 
I will make it fair to thieves. I will make it a single cast mage/cleric spell.
 
Also it will only last 5-10 ticks be level 60 and 50 mana. So players
better hope their players and clerics love them.
 
 
Another thing I have done was added a few more spots, On thief mobs, for flash powder to load.
There was one mob at 1% that flash loaded on.
 
There is 2 mobs in 2 cities that load it and one thief in a dtrap area that loads it.
 
I will post when detect-cham is in. However you got to find it and there will be no hints on it's location.

Clerics could use an xp/fload spell. We cannot solo check areas with guards, or fload even medium size mobs. Since an xp spell prevents clerics from doing damage in pk and allows the class to explore, I think it is a good idea. P.s. healing spells should do more hps than damage spells of same mana/cast time (+blind -str -dex).
Mostly others have said the heals are too little, they must have played healer before because I was ok with the amount till I started seeing damage of the same amount in the same time - that does not seem right but others should give opinions.

3: pick a spokes person to talk in all of your places

and setup a party to listen to what needs to be done. Then that party gets together and talks to
the spokes man and they decide on what is a good point and what is not.
5: Have the spokemen write an email of what you all agree on to make this place better.
 
If this is not done then I guess stuff will keep being fixed as it is now.
You do it this way we will try and fixed as the email states.
 
Until you all decide when you want to do this pretty much I will not touch anything else.

Figure out what you wanted changed.
Put it in an email with the most important thing that needs to be fixed to the least.
as in like 1: fix healer spells, 2: lower backstab, 3: raise fly duration

Hey Njal,
Just trying to give you a final report on fire bolt.
It appears to do ERADICATE at the most, but mainly sticks to the realm of Liquify.
Makes me feel less useless at lower levels, I actually do damage now!

Ok got the email however seems a few classes were left out.
 
Warriors?
Necromancers?
Warlocks?
Paladins?
Monks?
 
So are these classes ok?
 
A one day discussion I do not think is enough time for this.
yes you posted some good ideas however... More indepth I think would be good.
 
Study on one class at a time. from the ground up in your eyes. I want something about class.
 
I would like a decent email indepth of all classes. not just raise damage on top spells by 200.
or 1 powder mob.  How about more into help look into powder and see if there is a way to have a save
from the affects of powder.
 
 
either we can advance the mud or we can just go back to how the mud was (where everyone complained anyway)
 
 
Take more time and work a bit harder.

Text
The only good thing about necros was that if you ordered your demons to
assist you in time in PK (they don't automatically assist when a dark hits
u), you could get them aggro dark and it was a lot harder for them to stab
you cuz they would yell. Minions are annoying as hell to deal with because
their moves suck and you had to waste so much mana refreshing, especially
after they land and can't fly anymore. Necro spells are so bad.
Disintegration is the only decent spell, but it takes very long to cast,
much longer than incineration or whatever the mage equivalent is called. So
basically, you could do more damage with demons than with spells. Hellfire
is a terrible spell. Takes forever to cast and only does 400 hps damage.
Pass door is good. It is convenient, but not really useful since you can't
flee away from mobs with it. Basically, no one should play necros unless
they want quick xp. I am much more pleased with the mage class now that I am
done xping.

Hey, I've played a Necro a bit. The problem with them is they just
aren't that good. I'll explain why. The mobs run out of mvs extremely quick,
which makes them hard to keep with you when PKing. The spells do a lot less
then mages, I agree they should do less then sorcs, but not the gap its at
atm. Secondly, there are no differentials, there are like 8 damage necro
spells, where mages get about 30. I would add some more specialized things
for them, maybe add a couple spells that only they can do to make them stand
out. A couple ideas off the bat would make Necros only have a +1int spell.
Add a larger mana shield, that is capable of absorbing more. Maybe give them
phase shield instead. Although that puts them more in the role of tanks
which they aren't. I would add a larger variety of summonable mobs, and make
it so they don't loose mvs. Aside from that, I think they have the potential
of being one rocking class. 
 
Secondly, since molten and bale were lowered in damage, can we get a lower mana level? :)
Take care.

about at the meeting. We immortals asked them to look into the rest of the

I met with Bigperms, Kratos, carthax, zero and whoever else was around
old port. we agreed to these changes. Wrath of God is messed up and needs to
be changed/gone. We dunno what to do. CLERIC- we all agree on: 1. Searing

spells to be added:
2. Heavenfire (same as Balefire) -whatever name u guys
like. 3. summon (ressurection?  - i think that means from dead, not

seconds. No detect-cham in game. 1 powder mob MAGE- +200 to meteor and cata.
remove all affects except big fire spells get blind 
 
If you disagree with any of this, this is your LAST CHANCE to say something.  I will forward it to the committee to talk about.  If you have any additional ideas, please respond with them.  If you do not say anything, I will assume that everyone is fine with these changes.

Text
Okay, I've decided that it may be a good idea to post some of my ideas I've been mulling over for a couple days. I'm not sure how you'll be able to code all this cause I'm not really a coder/builder.
 
Paladins:
Holy Wrath: Gives the Paladin's weapon a 'shine'(blind) effect and grants him a extra attack each round for however long you guys decide to make it.
 
Paladin's Call: Grants the Paladin the ability to instantly teleport Clerics and Paladins to his position.
 
Warriors:
 
Double Edge: A high damage attack that does 2/3rds of its damage to the warrior but full damage to the target.
 
Charge: Gives Warriors the ability to do a low damage strike and a % chance of knocking the target a room or maybe even 2 rooms away with a 1 second lag.
 
Craft: Warriors can 'sharpen' their weapons and harden their armor but in doing so makes the weapon and armor warrior only until its restored at a blacksmith to its original state.
 
Monk:
 
Grapple/Fist/Kick/None: Grants Monks the ability to focus on certain points. The Grappling way of fighting will make it a bit more difficult to flee and cast spells while the monk is attacking but will lower their damage.
Fist fighting will make the Monk's strikes have a better chance of landing but do less damage. And last is kicking, which is pretty much the opposite of Punching. This can stack with their stances if you want or not, its all really up to you guys.
 
Nerve Strike: The monk strikes multiple pressure points causing a chance of 1 second delay for however long.
 
Knockout: The monk delivers a wild roundhouse kick that does decent damage and may render you unconcious for a set amount of time.
 
Rogue: 
 
Envenom Weapon: The rogue can envenom his or someone elses weapon granting the ability to give very minor delay to whoever you hit. The effect could possibly stack for each person that poisons you or something.
 
Hail of Daggers: A very clever move preformed by the rogue, it does decent damage, little less than Balefire? Its a AOE that could have the possible effects depending on whats on your weapon, such as envenom or some kind of enchantment on it will add to the power of Hail of Daggers.
 
Trap: This may be incredibly rigged but hey, lets try it. 
Oops, hit enter. anyway! Lets try it: The rogue can lay down a max of 4 traps in one area. These traps could be any of the following:
Alarm: Alarms the whole area if a enemy trips it. Stun: knocks you out for a minor amount of time. Net: Immobilizes you for a little while, add the struggle command and that'll give you a chance of getting out of net.
Fire: Causes a small-decent amount of damage to the idiot that trips it, can be tripped up to 3 times, also anyone within a 15 room radius will see the burst of flames and from which direction it came.
 
This is all I have for you guys now. Feedback would be nice but don't be an asshole if you don't like my ideas, there are polite ways of dealing with stuff like this.

Ok here is the deal.
 
We have talked about a freeze/reroll option.
 
 
Some players do not want it and some do. However I feel 1 week is not ehough time to play as rerolled character
and me and Sabelis can not come up with any good time options. I give a month time she says that is
too long. I do not want this to be well I am bored of this character let me have my other character back
in a weeks time. If you are going to do this I feel you should spend time on this new character.
I feel that if you get pked or whatnot you should not be able to run back to your other character just because
it is there. So is a month too long of a freeze time? So here is the deal. Nothing less the 3 weeks
and nothing more then a month. if the mud agrees on letting everyone have this option.
 
However on this option HUMANS CAN NOT ASCEND so do not roll a human expecting to ascend.
Also you ascend into the next race up that you choose from the begining :p
This means you pick a Dark-Elf you become a Lich.
 
I have also fixed the ascend +stats so that the points will be put onto your character the correct way.
 
Give the Yes or No's on this subject and we will see by Friday.

This note refers to note 179
 
This note only applies to people who want to freeze their character and reroll a new character.
If they get enough wps and whatnot to ascend they can not remort into another race. they must ascend
from the race they are now to the ascend race the race that are is to become.
 
I am not sure on how to explain it more :p

I know Kilith's and Sabelis' position on the +dex item that is in the game. That is not what I'm arguing about. It is clear the mud needs a way of differing non ascended thieves from ascended thieves. If non ascended thieves are hitting max damage, why ascend?
That is exactly what Samson thought, and he just happens to have the dex item but that is besides the point. There needs to be a 31 dex marker with a heavy weight on it for stab/circle. If the item is taken out and the only +stat item is tier, it is a simple way to fix the problem.
Also, I've been having thoughts of doing what Samson did with going back to non ascended. I know all the things I'd have to do and not be able to ascend bla bla bla, but with these changes I don't know if monks (the reason I ascended to colossus that got nerfed) will go back to the way they were.
Monks were made (says Psi, the one who made them) to do little damage in even fights, but do very good damage in outnumbered fights. I had a maxxed out colossus monk fighting no ac and no sanc enemies one vs eight and did a pulv. If they got lowered because of that...
As far as monks go, it is a dangerous job. I've seen too many times a group of 5-6 take 1.5k hps off someone in a single smash. A monk has to actually go and try to fight those odds just to do damage. I think that is based on how fast the monk could die, they should be rewarded with decent damage.

i dont exactly agree with freezing chars and rolling new ones, but maybe it will be good it might up pk etc with more people out their xp'n etc
however i would ask that all chars be frozen completely naked, no EQ at all so there will be no pstoring of any sense, because i will freeze my mage EQ and all and roll a thief and fload EQ for my mage, completely abusing this system
just my 2 cents ( not like anyone listens)

gotta say.  well written note, some ideas I think are pretty good, but some I just don't know about.
one of the main things I saw, is that really, rogues, warriors and monks are generally fine,
monks are still huge as mobkillers, and the balance for them is somewhat decent for pkill, warriors are
in my opinion the best rounded class loc has ever had.  and thieves are just well, thieves (although
your hail of daggers idea sounded cool).  not sure an area blind will really do much to help paladins
and a power summon like that could be overly abused I think.

I don't think it is a good idea. I think there are too many ways to abuse it and much more harm than good that can come from it. What I think should happen is what we've had on other LOC's.That is, reascending. Ascend remorts are many wps
Ascend remorts are many wps so if someone who was able to hit like 7 mort ascended and used all those wps wanted to reascend, why not let them? It's not like everyone will be doing it. Only the few people who can hit 7 mort ascend can even do it. Sometimes a race gets boring and the player needs change.

A vote was taken to say if freeze/reroll would be a good thing. I remember seeing a note saying only 1 person voted for no. Bigperm and I both said no and that note just happened to vanish. WTF is going on?
I just got word that Kilith had the +stat quest item so high that no one would be able to get it. Then, Kilith lowered the cost of it just so Samson could get the item. WTF IS GOING ON?!
Then, someone spam died (no clue who) and was deleted for it. However, in help rules it says if someone spam kills they lose ALL wps. Why did no one lose wps if someone spam died?
If all this information I've got is true then I have one question to ask... can we bring Structure back as head imm?

at least 7 or 9 others that voted yes. I have no idea what happened to your
note. I don't even remember seeing it. I haven't removed ANY MESSAGES from
this board recently. 
 
Second of all, the only reason I agreed to have the plus stat item in is
because he was going to make it high enough that no one could get it, but
the quest was changed so we had to change stuff on how it was dealt with.
It was NOT PURPOSELY made so Samson could get it.  It was still high enough
otherwise there would be MORE THAN ONE in the game, which there is not.
 
Third of all, I'm not going to release who spam died because they rerolled
with the same name.  If they do it again, they will be sitebanned.  Also,
you don't have a clue what anyone had done to them so I don't wanna hear it.
 
Fourth of all, if you continue this bitching.. you will no longer be welcome

Subject spam death/pk~
Text
Ok this spam pk is a very tricky deal.
In help rules it is all fubar.
 
Here is the problem with the help rules.
Rule: Do not spam kill one person. Spam killing or spam dying is defined as
      more than two times in a row within an hour. Sometimes people give up.
      Leave.
 
They broke gates on homelands town (sap) and so because someone spam dies suicides to them
should they have to leave that town? My opinion is I do not think so.
They did not attack him or break the rules.
 
However the rule that WAS broken was Rule: Do not spam die to the members of the opposite alignment.  If you are
      unsure what spam dying is considered please look at the previous rule
      for the definition.  This will result in deletion.
 
They did not attack this person after the first death. This person attacked them
after the first death (while they were fighting Hanggar) and suicided to them.
 
 
The person who spam died broke the rules. They were deleted because of it.
Warped, Carthax, Kratos, Torak, Terminator, and Anarchy
were the people in the room when he spam died to them. Warped left before the last death
because he didnt want to be nailed for spam killing someone. Thing is they got bearly
any warpoints from this since it was a hoard. The other problem they did not
break the rules. The person that spam died did.
 
The rules migth not be clear? but they didnt chase him and spam pk him. He chased them and spam died.
 
So no they will not be punished for someone that broke the rules and should have staied in the portal
and cooled off and logged. The rule broke was spam dying not spam killing.
 
The person knew they were in sap and still choose to leave portal.
That is the end of story about this matter.

There are other mages that aren't losing concentration on spells through
this spell. You are not maxed out on remorts/levels yet so your focus isn't
at the max it can go. I'm pretty sure that Bigperms can cast through an acid
arrow because a whitie has said something about his concentration not
getting broken by 13 hit twist or so. 
 
Also, I believe mages spells are high damage enough therefore you do not
need the extra stat like the rest of the classes do.
