Name On a Road to an Open pit Mine~
Descr
The mountains part here to reveal a narrow pass. As you look farther down
the trail, you can see a thick forest scarred by a barren, open pit. A short
walk past the pit, you see a huge smoldering cone of ash. When the wind
blows just right, you catch a faint whiff of sulfur.

Beastmasters goad mules around the edge of the pit, urging them to raise
loads of stone hung from ropes. Perhaps you should stand out of the way.

Name Clearing in Front of Buildings~
Descr
Just south of this room you see a tool shed. East is a warehouse, and it
is heavily guarded. On the north side of the warehouse, there is a building
with a huge smokestack belching smoke and fire of various colors. To the
north, you see a long line of workers waiting outside another building.

Name A Shed Full of Tools~
Descr
This is the main stool storage for the mine. The walls are lined with
pickaxes, helmets with lights, coils of rope, and many other items. Miners
filter in and out of this shed in a more or less steady stream, picking up
new materials to help them work the stone outside.

Name Warehouse~
Descr
This is the warehouse for the mine. You really shouldn't be in here
without permission. The only way to walk through this room is by using the
narrow aisles between bins of valuable ores. You can see iron, copper, and
other minerals. There is a large vault in the corner. There appears to be a
yellowish dust on the floor in front of the vault.

Name Processing Room for ore~
Descr
In this room, metallurgists work around the clock to process the minerals
the miners excavate. Sweat pours down your back as the furnaces around the
walls generate gales of superheated air. Alchemists recite chants over the
melted substances, which further purifies the metals. This results in great
volumes of smoke and strange gases, which, for the most part, are drawn
through massive chimneys in the roof. Nevertheless, the lingering remnants
of the fumes sting your eyes and instantly dry your throat.

Name Foreman's Shack~
Descr
This is the office of the foreman. From this location, he has a good view
of his operation. The bosses of various gangs of workers run in and out of
the office, getting instructions and then passing them on to others outside.
Against the back wall is the foreman's desk, and behind it is the only chair
in the room. Obviously the foreman is the only one who will be comfortable
being in this room.

everywhere you look. Standing at its base, hanging from ropes to dig at the
middle of the face, and hanging off the edge to the next level down. The

This is the northwest corner of the mine. About seventy feet blow, you
see tiny figures running back and forth across the bottom of the mine. Here
in the corner, you see water mages generating great blasts of water to knock
the rock free, and to wash dirt away from the valuable stone. Occasionally,
a water mage will stop to fill a huge waterskin for one of the workers or a
waterboy, but then he goes back to pummeling the stone walls with his art.

You are floating in the corner of a large chamber in the cave. The walls

that the large bubble in the stone comes to an end. To the west, you see
that the large bubble in the stone comes to an end. To the west, you can see
an alcove choked with colorful and delicate-looking plants. The most
noticable feature of this chamber is a huge pillar of flawless blood red
stone near the center of the bubble.
